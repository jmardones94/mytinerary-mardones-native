# MyTinerary Mobile

This is a one-week project developed while attending MindHub's coding bootcamp on MERN stack, finished on October 3rd.
A few weeks earlier I developed a web version, so I re-used that backend, hosted on heroku.

The main technologies used here were:

* React Native
* Redux
* React Navigation 5
* Formik + Yup
